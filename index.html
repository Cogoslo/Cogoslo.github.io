    hi, i'm ada, and this is my site!!
    <br>
    i'm an aspiring trans girl developer, who wants to learn more things
    <br>
    i love a lot of things, and are not a fan of a lot of things, but i'm
    <br>
    Passionate, for every craft i dive into, and try to keep myself
    <br>
    enjoying life, by making myself do projects, when i don't have anything
    <br>
    better to do. this website is one of those projects.

<pre class="textzone">
as you can see, i'm a fan of how things used to look
whether it's some form of nostalgia for a time i never existed in,
or some form of retro-futuristic idealism i wish for a better
internet, where people decidehow the internet is, instead
of businesses deciding how our internet should be.
