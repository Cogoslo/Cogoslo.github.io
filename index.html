hi, i'm ada, and this is my site!!<br>
i'm an aspiring trans girl developer, who wants to learn more things i love a lot of things, and are not a fan of a lot of things, but i'm passionate, for every craft i dive into, and try to keep myself enjoying life, by making myself do projects, when i don't have anything better to do. this website is one of those projects.</pre>

as you can see, i'm a fan of how things used to look whether it's some form of nostalgia for a time i never existed in, or some form of retro-futuristic idealism i wish for a better internet, where people decide how the internet is, instead of businesses deciding how our internet should be.
